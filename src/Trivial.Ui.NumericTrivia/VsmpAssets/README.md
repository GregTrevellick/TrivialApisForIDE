# Numeric Trivia

A light-hearted and meaningless extension that displays a random number-related fact / piece of trivia when opening a solution file.

- Impress your geek peers or bore your spouse/kids with your new found nerdy numerical knowledge.

- If you like this ***free*** extension, please give it a [review][VSMarketplaceUrl].

- Aided and abetted by the good folks at [Numbers API](http://www.numbersapi.com).

- Inspired by [Phil Haack's Encourage](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Haacked.Encourage) extension.
