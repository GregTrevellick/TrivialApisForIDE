The API appends a "Response Code" to each API Call to help tell developers what the API is doing.
Code 0: Success Returned results successfully.
Code 1: No Results Could not return results. The API doesn't have enough questions for your query. (Ex. Asking for 50 Questions in a Category that only has 20.)
Code 2: Invalid Parameter Contains an invalid parameter. Arguements passed in aren't valid. (Ex. Amount = Five)
Code 3: Token Not Found Session Token does not exist.
Code 4: Token Empty Session Token has returned all possible questions for the specified query. Resetting the Token is necessary.
